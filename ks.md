From the graphs above, we can see a direct relationshop between `$USD` and number of `backers`. On the other hand, sometimes there is a big difference between number of `backers` and `projects`, caused by having this month some of the [most backed projects](https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/advanced?sort=most_backed&seed=2553607&page=1) sharing campaign: for instance in October 2016, this big gap is a result of [this](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elanlee/bears-vs-babies-a-card-game?ref=discovery) + [this](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/antsylabs/fidget-cube-a-vinyl-desk-toy?ref=discovery). Same for `USD` and `projects`, there was a very successful and expensive game ([this beauty](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/poots/kingdom-death-monster-15?ref=most_funded&ref=discovery)) launching in November 2016.

> Tip 1: Don't create your campaign in **December**, people is busy buying other stuff.
