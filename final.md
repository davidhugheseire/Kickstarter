## Final thoughts and and future work

* Choose a classification technique (k-NNs, SVC, Random Forest, etc) and create a real prediction model. 
* Create a website based on it that can determine if the project you have in your head would be succesful or not with a given % accuracy.
* SSO embed in GitHub Pages project.
* Ammend the `Kickstarter` dataset with a new column containing the `bgg name` field related to that specific `project name`, in order to not to miss data when joining both tables in the explore{}.
* Stop buying more games, and play them!
