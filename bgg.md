# What is the BGG?

[This](https://boardgamegeek.com/) 90's looking page is the reference website for gamers. It has information from 10.000 games, but for this analysis we will consider only the TOP 5% (5000).

This is what happens if we divide them by released year:

If you check the graph above, more games doesn't equal to better games (used the `geek rating`), and again, we are not counting 95% of them that hasn't made the cut!

But which percentage of them comes from KS?
