[This](https://boardgamegeek.com/) 90's looking page is the reference website for gamers. It has information from 10.000 games, but for this analysis we will consider only the TOP 5% (5000), which still a bunch.

This is what happens if we divide them by released year:

If you check the graph above, **more games doesn't equal to better games** (used the `geek rating`), and again, we are not counting 95% of them that hasn't made the cut!

Since 2011, there are much more games released in KS that the industry could even play:

But which percentage of them comes from KS?

As per that graph, very few KS games made the top 100 so far :/.

And the question is: Is a large overfunded game equals to a good ranked one?

> Tip 7: A very successful campaign doesn't mean that the game is good. Some of the best ranked games have barely met their funding goal.
