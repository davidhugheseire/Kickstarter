# What is the BGG?

[This](https://boardgamegeek.com/) 90's looking page is the reference website for gamers. It has information from 10.000 games, but for this analysis we will consider only the TOP 5% (5000).

This is what happens if we divide them by released year:

If you check the graph above, more games doesn't equal to better games (used the `geek rating`), and again, we are not counting 95% of them that hasn't made the cut!

Since 2011, there are much more games released in KS that the industry could even play:

But which percentage of them comes from KS?

And the question is: Is a large overfunded game equals to a good ranked one?

> Tip 7: A very successful campaign doesn't mean that the game is good. Some of the best ranked games have barely met their funding goal.

As a reference, we include the top 10 games in BGG that have started as a KS campaign:

We can find there mid-to-heavy games from the last 5 years (Cult of the new) with tons of miniatures.

Gloomhaven is a good example of a game that came from nowhere, had an average campaign but the word of mouth lead to second [campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1350948450/gloomhaven-second-printing), 10 times more successful than the first one. Now ranks as TOP1 in BGG.
