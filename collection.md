As a reference, we include the top 10 games in BGG that have started as a KS campaign:

We can find there mid-to-heavy games from the last 5 years (Cult of the new) with tons of miniatures.

Gloomhaven is a good example of a game that came from nowhere, had an average campaign but the word of mouth lead to second [campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1350948450/gloomhaven-second-printing), 10 times more successful than the first one. Now ranks as TOP1 in BGG and it's been on my table for weeks now.

This year so far, I've backed 6 KS campaigns, I hadalso to adapt to this new industry shift: we no longer go to a shop to buy something, but we do help a crazy project on somebody's head come to life and then wait for a year to own it.
