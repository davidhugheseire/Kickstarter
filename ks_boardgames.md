# And what about the Board Games?

[TableTop Gaming](https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/games/tabletop%20games) is the second most funded category in KS, and it seems that nothing is going to change in the future:

We can see a **linear trend** during the past years but, more important, by 2025, the number of successful projects per month will be the **double**. What is more, **72%** of the projects in this category will be successful, this is a good indicator of the hobby acceptance and bright future. 

Translated into **money**, so far:

Which correspond with the

from the total.

Where is this money coming from?

This makes a lot of sense as Modern Board Games popularity raise started in Germany on the 90's (Catan, Carcassone, etc), and got spread over Europe soon after. EU has a more traditional business system: publishers and games coming to Retail. US doesn't have that many established publishers, so geeks/FLGS/online shops needs to order them from overseas at a high cost.

> Tip 4: If you want to play a safe bet, move to France. Another example: World Cup.

This seems a good business to be in, but, is there any rule for this? **What makes a Board Game campaign succesful?**

If we compare BoardGames with the rest of the KS population:

Here we realize that:

- Tabletop fans are passionate, they back way more and on higher pledges than the average.

- A shorter campaign usually has a better performance than a long one (!).

> Tip 5: Shorter here is better. 29 days is a good duration.

Let's focus a little bit more on the `funding goal`:

</iframe></p>

- Succesful projects has a project goal 2 times less than failed.

**The higher the funding goal is, the more risk you add to your campaign.** The most succesful tier is: $1,000.00,$5,000.00.

But normally, you don't want to only reach your funding goal, but also get a high `overfunding rate`, is this common?

Not that much! Historically, a game gets funded up to max of 9 times of its funding, but this is changing:

> Tip 6: Don't put a high goal in your campaign in case you want to assure funding. But, if you have confidence and have a hit on hands, you might tempt the odds.

We have been talking about the campaign but one other thing that comes in the picture is the actual *quality* of the product. Are these projects any good? How is this affecting to the industry? Is this the end of the physical shops? To answer this, we will need to ask the ones that know more: **the geeks**.
