# And what about the Board Games?

TableTop Gaming is the second most funded category in KS, and it seems that nothing is going to change in the future:

We can see a **linear trend** during the past years but, more important, by 2025, the number of successful projects per month will be the **double**. What is more, **72%** of the projects in this category will be successful, this is a good indicator of the hobby acceptance and bright future. 

Translated into money, so far:

Which correspond with the **15%** of the total.






Where is this money coming from?

This makes a lot of sense as Modern Board Games popularity raise started in Germany on the 90's (Catan, Carcassone, etc), and got spread over Europe soon after. EU has a more traditional business system: publishers and games coming to Retail. US doesn't have that many established publishers, so geeks/FLGS/online shops needs to order them from overseas at a high cost.

This seems a good business, but, is there any rule for this? **What makes a Board Game campaign succesful?**
