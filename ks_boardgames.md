# And what about the Board Games?

TableTop Gaming is the second most funded category in KS, and it seems that nothing is going to change in the future:

We can see a **linear trend** during the past years but, more important, by 2025, the number of successful projects per month will be the **double**. What is more, **72%** of the projects in this category will be successful, this is a good indicator of the hobby acceptance and bright future. 

Translated into money, so far:

Which correspond with the **15%** of the total.

Where is this money coming from?

This makes a lot of sense as Modern Board Games popularity raise started in Germany on the 90's (Catan, Carcassone, etc), and got spread over Europe soon after. EU has a more traditional business system: publishers and games coming to Retail. US doesn't have that many established publishers, so geeks/FLGS/online shops needs to order them from overseas at a high cost.

> Tip 4: If you want to play a safe bet, move to France. Another example: World Cup.

This seems a good business to be in, but, is there any rule for this? **What makes a Board Game campaign succesful?**

If we compare BoardGames with the rest of the KS population:

Here we realize that:

- Tabletop fans are passionate, they back way more and on higher pledges than the average.

- A shorter campaign usually is more successful than a long one (!).

> Tip 5: Short campaigns have better performance than long ones. 29 days is a good duration.

Let's focus a little bit more on the `funding goal`:

</iframe></p>

The higher the funding goal is, the more risk you add to your campaign. The most succesful tier is: $1,000.00,$5,000.00.

But normally, you don't want to only reach your funding goal, but also get a high overfunding rate, is this common?

</iframe></p>

Not that much! Normally a game gets funded up to max of 9 times of its funding.

> Tip 6: Don't put a high goal in your campaign in you want it funded. But, if you have confidence and have a hit on hands, you might.
